Program to reconstruct sorghum plants from depth images and make measurements of the reconstruction

This software is provided as is, without warranty or guarantee that it will work, and many features remain untested.

\section*{Workflow}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A series of depth images representing a single plant are converted to point clouds and registered.
\item The pot is segmented out from the registered clouds, and a final round of registration is performed.
\item The registered cloud is meshed (using a combination of Mesh\-Lab and Screened Poisson Surface Reconstruction; these are external to the Sorghum\-Reconstruction\-And\-Phenotyping program).
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Mesh\-Lab -\/ \href{http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/}{\tt http\-://meshlab.\-sourceforge.\-net/}
\item Screened Poisson Surface Reconstruction -\/ \href{http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Code/PoissonRecon/Version8.0/}{\tt http\-://www.\-cs.\-jhu.\-edu/$\sim$misha/\-Code/\-Poisson\-Recon/\-Version8.\-0/}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The plant mesh is segmented into stem, leaves, and inflorescence using a machine learning approach (trained on point features)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Multi\-Boost -\/ \href{http://www.multiboost.org/}{\tt http\-://www.\-multiboost.\-org/}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Individual leaves are segmented out using supervoxels and geodesic lengths across the mesh.
\item Measurements of the entire plant mesh and individual plant organs are made.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{Compilation}

First, make sure you can compile a project that depends on P\-C\-L and Open\-C\-V (e.\-g., \href{http://codextechnicanum.blogspot.com/2014/10/installing-point-cloud-library-and.html}{\tt http\-://codextechnicanum.\-blogspot.\-com/2014/10/installing-\/point-\/cloud-\/library-\/and.\-html}). On an Ubuntu system, P\-C\-L and Open\-C\-V can be obtained from the apt package manager, but I recommend compiling P\-C\-L from source (e.\-g., \href{http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/compiling_pcl_posix.php}{\tt http\-://pointclouds.\-org/documentation/tutorials/compiling\-\_\-pcl\-\_\-posix.\-php}) so that you have access to an up to date version and ability to turn on things like fitting N\-U\-R\-B\-S and B-\/splines (e.\-g., \href{http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/bspline_fitting.php}{\tt http\-://pointclouds.\-org/documentation/tutorials/bspline\-\_\-fitting.\-php}).

If you can compile P\-C\-L and code that depends on P\-C\-L, you should be able to use those build options in your I\-D\-E of choice, add all of the source files to your project, and compile. At some point in the future, an improved installation process will hopefully be added.

As a personal note, the hardest part (for me) was tracking down where on your system the necessary libraries are stored. You can find a list of the necessary includes and libs to link to in the M\-A\-K\-E\-F\-I\-L\-E. The M\-A\-K\-E\-F\-I\-L\-E itself was autogenerated from a Code\-Blocks configuration and is untested, and is provided more as an example of the includes and libs you need rather than something that you can expect to run make with.
